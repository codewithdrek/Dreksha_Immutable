	 * Q1. What is the difference between Singleton and immutable? Design Ans.
	 * Singleton class will have only one instance through out your application.
	 * Once the instance has been created, you can use it to change the state of
	 * that object, whereas for immutable class you cannot change the value that
	 * means you cannot change the state of it once assigned.
